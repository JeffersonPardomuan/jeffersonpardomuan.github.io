title: VabricBeads :Variable Stiffness Structured Fabric using Artificial
Muscle in Woven Beads

summary: Woven beads, a structured fabric category, comprises interconnected rows of beads joined by fiber strands. While the stiffness of woven beads can be adjusted by relying on fiber tension during fabrication, the resulting shape and stiffness properties remain fixed. This study explores the potential of tunable shape and stiffness in woven beads, offering adaptability in comfort, functionality, and form factor. By leveraging Pneumatic Artificial Muscles (PAMs), we employ a state-of-the-art technique for dynamically modulating fabric stiffness through mechanical constraints in bead form. This approach enables a modular and scalable fabrication process, fostering programmability in mechanical properties. Our investigation encompasses diverse bead iterations and stitching patterns to broaden their applicability in fabric behavior including degree of freedom, stretchability, permeability, and textures. We evaluate the mechanical properties to differentiate design capabilities, and present techniques for locally adjusting stiffness. We showcase the versatility through applications, including variable stiffness wearables and shape-changing everyday objects.
