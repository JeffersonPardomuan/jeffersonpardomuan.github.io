abstract: Prototyping a shape-changing interface is challenging because it requires
  knowledge of both electronics and mechanical engineering. In this study, we introduced
  a prototyping platform using a soft pneumatic artificial muscle(PAMs) and modular
  3D printed reinforcement. To facilitate a wide variety of applications we propose
  six types of reinforcement modules capable of either shape deformation and/or variable
  stiffness. Users can create an approximate prototype using lego-built modules with
  magnetic connectors. A modeling toolkit can then be used to recreate and customize
  the prototype structure. After 3D printing, the shape-changing interface can be
  assembled by threading the PAMs through holes in the reinforcement. We envision
  that this prototyping platform can be useful in shape-changing interface exploration,
  where researchers can create working prototypes easily, rapidly, and at a low cost.
