abstract: With the growing need for wheelchairs, much wheelchair research has focused
  on wheelchair control, such as fully automatic driving and remote control. For wheelchair
  users, conversations with caregivers and others around the wheelchair are also important
  and must be considered. Therefore, we propose a system that connects the users to
  remote caregivers and others by using omnidirectional displays. Our system allows
  remote caregivers to observe both the users and their surroundings and to control
  the wheelchair, while the users and others feel the existence of remote caregivers.
  We conducted a system evaluation and user interviews to demonstrate that the proposed
  system augments wheelchair usersâ€™ experience.
