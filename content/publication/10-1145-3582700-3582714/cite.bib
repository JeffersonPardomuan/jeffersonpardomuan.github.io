 abstract = {With the growing need for wheelchairs, much wheelchair research has focused on wheelchair control, such as fully automatic driving and remote control. For wheelchair users, conversations with caregivers and others around the wheelchair are also important and must be considered. Therefore, we propose a system that connects the users to remote caregivers and others by using omnidirectional displays. Our system allows remote caregivers to observe both the users and their surroundings and to control the wheelchair, while the users and others feel the existence of remote caregivers. We conducted a system evaluation and user interviews to demonstrate that the proposed system augments wheelchair users’ experience.},
