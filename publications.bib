abstract = {With the growing need for wheelchairs, much wheelchair research has focused on wheelchair control, such as fully automatic driving and remote control. For wheelchair users, conversations with caregivers and others around the wheelchair are also important and must be considered. Therefore, we propose a system that connects the users to remote caregivers and others by using omnidirectional displays. Our system allows remote caregivers to observe both the users and their surroundings and to control the wheelchair, while the users and others feel the existence of remote caregivers. We conducted a system evaluation and user interviews to demonstrate that the proposed system augments wheelchair users’ experience.},

abstract = {We introduce LUNAChair, a remote control and communication system that uses omnidirectional video to connect a remote caregiver to a wheelchair user and a third person around the wheelchair. With the recent growing need for wheelchairs, much of the wheelchair research has focused on wheelchair control, such as fully automatic driving and remote operation. For wheelchair users, conversations with caregivers and third persons around them are also important. Therefore, we propose a system that connects a wheelchair user and a remote caregiver using omnidirectional cameras, which allows the remote caregiver to control the wheelchair while observing both the wheelchair user and his/her surroundings. Moreover, the system facilitates communication by using gaze and hand pointing estimation from an omnidirectional video.},

abstract = {Prototyping a shape-changing interface is challenging because it requires knowledge of both electronics and mechanical engineering. In this study, we introduced a prototyping platform using a soft pneumatic artificial muscle(PAMs) and modular 3D printed reinforcement. To facilitate a wide variety of applications we propose six types of reinforcement modules capable of either shape deformation and/or variable stiffness. Users can create an approximate prototype using lego-built modules with magnetic connectors. A modeling toolkit can then be used to recreate and customize the prototype structure. After 3D printing, the shape-changing interface can be assembled by threading the PAMs through holes in the reinforcement. We envision that this prototyping platform can be useful in shape-changing interface exploration, where researchers can create working prototypes easily, rapidly, and at a low cost.},
